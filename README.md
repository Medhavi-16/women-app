# FEMbrace

## Inspiration
We researched and found that there are many apps for women, but they are limited to a specific section. For a woman to get access to help and care in different aspects, she has to load her mobile with multiple apps.


## FEMbrace
FEMbrace is an app _**' for women, by women '**_.
It is an amalgamation of various features to support and empower women to help the women's community in the most basic and effortless ways. It is a community that depends on the women being able to share their views on things that would benefit other women. 
From finding a safe community to keeping up with your health, this app has got you covered.

## Challenges and how we overcame them
Two of our team members had a background in mobile app development using React Native, and the other member had a web development background. We decided to go with a mobile app, but it became a little overwhelming for the third member to learn React Native in a short amount of time. Moreover, we came up with many features and had to filter them for the most relevant and do-able features. This cost us some time. But our past experiences in hackathons came in handy, and with teamwork, we were able to come up with a working app.

## Achievements we are proud of
We are most proud of the number of features we were able to finish in just 24 hours. We are proud of our UI since none of us are UI designers. We are also proud that even if the team members were from different domains, we could still develop a cohesive app.

* Find Toilets: The following pictures clearly portray the conditions of public toilets/restrooms. What kind of effects bad hygiene has on a woman is also shown next to it. So one would refrain from using such a toilet if she somehow knows about its conditions. This is the inspiration behind our next feature.

## Chatroom: 
A safe space for you to ask any question you want or seek support without embarrassment. 
How?
* The names and any other thing which could reveal your identity won't be displayed along with the messages. As a future scope, we'll be using cryptography to hide the sender's details.

* For each message that you write, it would be tested for foul words. If found, your 'discredibility' score will increment by one; when it crosses 5, you will enter a read-only mode, where you would see the chats but not post any.
&nbsp;

* ### Find collaboration/work opportunities:
While participating in hackathons, we realized that working with new people is an enlightening experience. Hackathons usually have channels to find team members. But what if you want someone to collaborate on music or a digital art projects, but not necessarily for a competition?  This is one of the key inspirations behind this section.
This section provides means for you to find your collaboration partners or help the women's community by posting about any job opportunity you know. 
Think of this as a more informal LinkedIn.
Just add a posting here with the relevant tags. Any user interested will connect with you.
